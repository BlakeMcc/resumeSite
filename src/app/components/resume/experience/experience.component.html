          JumpStart is a small elite team based out of Chicago with the goal to bring the best of technology and architecture to the rest of Accenture. 
          We work side by side with client project counterparts to bring concepts like DevOps and Microservices leveraging Kubernetes or Serverless to our teams. 
          <br> <br> I've been on the JumpStart initiative for a year, becoming a Senior member of the team. I've lead engagements for multiple clients 
          and constantly look for new technologies or frameworks to improve our stack.<br>
